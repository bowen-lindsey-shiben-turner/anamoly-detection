Email to Team:


Hello,

I have some questions for you that I need to be answered before the board meeting Thursday afternoon. I need to be able to speak to the following questions. I also need a single slide that I can incorporate into my existing presentation (Google Slides) that summarizes the most important points. My questions are listed below; however, if you discover anything else important that I didnâ€™t think to ask, please include that as well.

## Project Goals:

- To answer a set of questions and provide additional feedback on findings
- Submit a link to a final notebook on GitHub that asks and answers questions 
- Properly ocument the work done to justify findings
- Compose an email with the answers to the questions/your findings, and in the email, include the link to your notebook in GitHub and attach your slide.
