    "   - The bottom 5% of program accessors have up to 624 access occurance through the duration of their programs which is much higher than the bottom 5%, but almost twice as low as the access occurance mean which is 1041.\n",
    "   - Cohort appears to be a signifanct factor in user access, but it is unclear why as the program dates and program type do not seem to be a factor.\n",
    "   \n",
    "       - The top 3 cohorts with the greatest average access (over 1200 average access occurances) are:\n",
    "         - Apex (program: full stack java, dates: 2020-02-04 to 2020-07-29)\n",

    "    \n",
    "   - The exploration of individual users to program access amount revealed that the students with low access have a high probability (~50% for bottom 25% of users and ~65% for bottom 5% of users) of ceasing to access the curriculum over a month before the program end date. The last access day, especially for the bottom 25%, appears to occur at a somewhat steady rate throughout the duration of the program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Next Steps: With the data available in this dataset, I cannot draw conclusions on why the bottom accessors cease accessing the curriculum and I'd like to request more data to evaluate the following questions:\n",
    "   - Do students stop accessing because they feel they've acquired enough knowledge? (assess a relationship between access and student performance)\n",
    "   - Could ceasing access be due to dropping out of the program? If so, how often does this occur?\n",
    "   - Do the instructors seem to influence the amount of program access?\n",
